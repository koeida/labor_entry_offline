Offline labor sheet inputter

TODO:
* Get areas from labordb
* Menu:
** Load from folder
** Maybe default to most recent folder
* Sheet scroller: 
** Saves when you scroll
** If it doesn't validate and save, don't switch sheets

DONE:
* Save changes as you go: One file per sheet, batches of sheets are just sheets in a folder.
